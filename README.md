# Project Summary:
# I am going to use a linked list to simulate the children's game "telephone", where the first player starts with a sentence/phrase and whispers it to the person sitting next to them and then that person whispers it to the person sitting next to them and so on. This game is often used as a metaphor to represent human miscommunication, because when it's played the ending phrase is usually very different from the original phrase by the time it reaches the last person. My program will slightly alter the message as it reaches each "player", in a similar way to how it would be altered in a real game of telephone. The more "players" there are, the more the message will change.
